# Main toolkits to be developed

1. Consensus differential expression analysis

2. Network analysis

3. Regression analysis

4. Time serie anaylsis

5. Data pre-processing
   missing value (filtering, imputation)
   data normalization
   remove batch effect
   
6. Bio-marker analysis

## Consensus differential expression analysis

1. Support subset of clustering methods
2. add more clustering algorithms: SOM, NMF, 
3. clusters alignment (cluster label result from different methods are consistent).
4. Complement of consensus cluster result, like dbscan...
5. Relationship between clusters and phenotype data. Correlation, Fisher exact test...
6. Feature selection.
7. Can change consensus.method when using plot_consensus_cluster.heatmap().
