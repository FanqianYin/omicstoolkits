# Main toolkits to be developed

1. Consensus differential expression analysis

2. Network analysis

3. Regression analysis

4. Time serie anaylsis

## Consensus differential expression analysis

1. Support subset of clustering methods
2. add more clustering algorithms
3. clusters alignment (cluster label result from different methods are consistent).
4. Complement of consensus cluster result, like dbscan...
